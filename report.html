        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>The English language teaching community is very big and while there are many sites that bring people in the industry togeher, I have yet to find a website that does this with good organization. This site is mainly for ESL / EFL teachers but is also for higher level students.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inspiration">
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Microsoft's Garage Website: When looking through different websites, I came across Microsoft's website and really like the simplcity of the design. I felt it looked clean and professional so it ended up greatly influencing my home page.</li>
            <li>www.awwwards.com: I often went through some of the recent sites of the day not for specific inspiration so much as to get a general feel for the spacing and use of color.</li>
            <li>Open Matter Blog: I quite liked how simple and easy to read the design is. As a whole I didn't like a lot of the design choices but I liked the 3 column grid that is easy to quickly read and navigate.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="accessibility">
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Color Contrast: I went through and made sure there was always a high level of color and tonal contrast. I then uploaded the site to an online checker.</li>
            <li>Alt Tags: I made sure to provide helpful alt tags for screen readers.</li>
            <li>Use of REMs: I used rems as much as possible so that the website scales nicely based on the user's choices. If they want to increase the font size, it won't break the design or the page.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="usability">
        <h2>Useability</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mobile Responsiveness: I made many changes to the mobile and tablet version of the site so that users can more easily read and use the site. For example, I made sure to use only columns in the main sections of the website at lower viewport widths. </li>
            <li>Clean and Simple: I emphasised simple designs that allow the user to quickly navigate to where they want to go. It also greatly helps with the user's ability to scan the pages.</li>
            <li>Consistency: There is a consistency across the website which allows the users to quickly know where they are and to recognize how to get to where they want.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="learning">
        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Flex Box: While I knew a little about flexbox at the beginning, I had to spend a lot of time learning more of the details to get my site to work well. For example, I had never even heard of flex-wrap until I was working on the Ideas and Resources pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                VS Code / Firefox: I learned a lot about how to better utilize VS Code and Firefox throughout the process. Some of the tricks like holding 'alt' to create multiple cursors sped up my production greatly. Also, being able to make changes directly in the browser or find out what css selectors were affecting what I was working on saved me many times.
            </li>
            <li>
                Responsiveness: I had never used media queries before this. I found that I constantly ran into issues trying to escape previous specificity and I have since read it is better to start with mobile and then go to desktop.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="eval-1">
        <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
        <p>I am quite happy overall with the layout and the colors. I believe the layout I created is quite intuitive for the user while not being boring. In regards to the colors, I feel that in the past I have always had issues with not only how to choose the colors but how to use them. This time I went with just 2 colors, one main color and an accent color. Then I used a few different shades of these colors throughout the site, with the darker ones being more prevalent as they help with contrast issues. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="eval-2">
        <h2>Evaluation II</h2>
        <p>As I mentioned above, I would definitely have done the mobile version first if I had more experience. I believe that I used a lot more css than necessary. I am also not fully happy with the layout of the text in the Ideas and Resources pages. I feel that maybe it is missing something such as the author or date. </p>
        <p>It was also my first time using SASS (SCSS) and even though I liked it a lot overall, I believe I made some errors with using css selectors due to the nesting. I also realized only at the very end that the comments with "//" don't get compiled into the CSS file and the other comments are not always exactly where I put them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="resources">
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>I found W3Schools to be very helpful. I went through some of the How To's for ideas and used the How-To for "Filter Elements" as the base of my filter script. </p>
        <p>I also found MDN to also be very helpful. I would often use it as a reference for specific CSS properties</p>
        <p>For all of my images, I used Envato Elements, to which I have a subscription.</p>

        <p>All MockUps are in the foler named "MockUps"</p>
        <p>The wire frames and Site Map are in the folder named "WireFrames"</p>
